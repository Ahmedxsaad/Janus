# Decision Log

Running log of project decisions. Newest first. Every significant decision gets
an entry: what we decided, the options considered, why, and the result.

## D-008: Move hackathon specs into docs/hackathon-specs/ (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad
- Decision: The eight captured Devpost spec files (01 to 08) plus their README
  index live in docs/hackathon-specs/.
- Options considered: none, direct request.
- Why: docs/ was mixing official hackathon reference with our own plan,
  research, and logs; separating them keeps docs/ navigable.
- Result: Moved 2026-07-08; docs/CLAUDE.md and root CLAUDE.md updated to match.

## D-007: Scaffold branch based on the docs branch (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Claude (for Ahmed Saad)
- Decision: Create chore/project-scaffold off docs/hackathon-plan-documents,
  not off main.
- Options considered: (a) branch off main, (b) branch off the docs branch,
  (c) commit the scaffold directly onto the docs branch.
- Why: The scaffold references the plan docs, which only exist on the docs
  branch; committing scaffold onto a docs-named branch would mix concerns.
- Result: Merge order is docs/hackathon-plan-documents first, then
  chore/project-scaffold.

## D-006: One CLAUDE.md per part, global rules only at the root (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad (requested), shaped by Claude
- Decision: A root CLAUDE.md holds all repo-wide rules; each directory gets a
  short local CLAUDE.md; every CLAUDE.md ends with a Change Log table.
- Options considered: (a) one big root file only, (b) root plus per-directory
  files with duplicated rules, (c) root plus short local files, no duplication.
- Why: Claude Code loads nested CLAUDE.md files only when working in that
  directory, so short local files optimize token usage; duplication rots.
- Result: 12 CLAUDE.md files created; duplication forbidden by the root file.

## D-005: Strip em dashes and emojis from all existing docs (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad (rule), applied by Claude
- Decision: Team rule is no em dashes and no emojis anywhere. Applied
  retroactively to docs/: em dashes become hyphens; semantic markers become
  text tags ([verified] for the checkmark, [confirm] for the warning sign,
  [paper]/[book]/[tool]/[standard]/[security] for the legend icons).
  Also renamed "less .md" (filename contained a space) to less.md.
- Options considered: (a) apply the rule to new content only, (b) full
  retroactive cleanup.
- Why: The user marked this rule as very important and universal; leaving
  hundreds of violations in tracked docs would contradict it.
- Result: Cleanup committed separately so the mechanical diff is easy to review.

## D-004: Conventional Commits, max 60-char subject (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad (requirements), format chosen by Claude
- Decision: type(scope): summary, imperative, lowercase, no period, max 60
  chars; one logical change per commit; branches named type/short-topic.
- Options considered: (a) Conventional Commits, (b) free-form prefixed
  messages, (c) gitmoji (rejected outright: emoji ban).
- Why: Conventional Commits is the de facto standard, is tooling-friendly,
  and matches the user's ask for a clear structure with short names.
- Result: Documented in root CLAUDE.md git rules.

## D-003: No stub code in the scaffold (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad (rule), applied by Claude
- Decision: The scaffold contains directories, documented __init__.py files,
  and config; zero function stubs. Files like cli.py, client.py, or detector
  modules are created only when actually implemented and tested.
- Options considered: (a) full stub tree with pass placeholders matching the
  plan layout, (b) docstring-only packages, code lands with implementation.
- Why: The team rule forbids empty functions and pass placeholders; stubs
  also mislead readers about what exists.
- Result: Package structure exists and imports cleanly; planned modules are
  named in each package docstring and CLAUDE.md instead.

## D-002: Adopt the plan's repo layout at the existing repo root (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Claude (for Ahmed Saad), per the plan
- Decision: Use the layout from docs/plan/02-implementation-plan.md section 2,
  placed directly at this repo's root (modelguard/ package plus skill/,
  mcp_ext/, examples/, benchmarks/, tests/ as siblings).
- Options considered: (a) nested modelguard/ project folder inside the repo,
  (b) plan layout at the repo root, (c) src/ layout.
- Why: The repo root is already the project; nesting adds a pointless level.
  src/ layout is a real alternative but deviates from the plan; raised in
  docs/plan/04-improvements.md instead of decided unilaterally.
- Result: Structure created 2026-07-08. Note: the repo is named DataHub while
  the project is ModelGuard; renaming is proposed in 04-improvements.md.

## D-001: Build ModelGuard, category 3 (2026-07-08)
- Decided by: Ahmed Saad
- Decision: Go with the plan folder: ModelGuard, Production ML Agents
  (category 3), with MigrationCopilot as the documented Week 1 fallback.
- Options considered: See docs/plan/01-strategy-modelguard.md (category
  analysis) and docs/more.md / docs/less.md (earlier candidate ideas).
- Why: Verified least-crowded category with the highest differentiation and
  maximal write-back surface; full argument in the strategy doc.
- Result: This scaffold. Week 1 gate: read column-level ML lineage plus write
  one incident and one structured property, or pivot.
